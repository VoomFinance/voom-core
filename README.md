# Voom Finance

In this poject we create the BEP20 Smart Contracts for [Voom Finance](https://voom.finance/) Version 1.0.

We use the framework [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) for development and test. 

This is the [Verified Address](https://bscscan.com/address/xxxxxxxxx#code) for the Voom Contract on  bscscan.com

### Initialize project libraries
The following libraries are necessary to be able to execute the smart contracts.
```
sudo npm i truffle -g
sudo npm i ganache-cli -g
npm i
```

### Power on development environment
Turn on the development environment for testing and running the tests.
```
ganache-cli
```

### Truffle commands
These commands are the ones necessary to compile smart contracts.
```
truffle compile
```

Select the network in which you are going to work to upload the smart contracts to the blockchain network
```
truffle migrate --network development --reset --compile-all
truffle migrate --network bsc --reset --compile-all
truffle migrate --network bsc_testnet --reset --compile-all
```


### Truffle Tests
Run unit tests for smart contracts
```
truffle test
```

### Build in production

1. Add a file called `.env` in the root of this repo and edit it, adding a line with your Private Key, somethink like:

 ```
MNENOMIC=PRIVATE_KEY
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=BSCSCAN_API_KEY
DEV_ADDRESS=DEV_ADDRESS
JETFUEL_POOL=ADDRESS
 ```
 and save it.
 
8. Enjoy your working BSC dApp!

### Smart contracts flattener

This command will create a single file of each smart contract, including its necessary libraries and others, this is necessary if you upload a single file to the verification of the smart contract in bscscan, but if you are going to upload multiple files for verification, the command is not necessary.

 ```
 sudo chmod +x ./flatten.sh
./flatten.sh
 ```

 ### Smart contracts (compile, verify, flattener)

This command is used to compile the contracts, upload them to the network, verify them and create a flat file of the smart contracts.

 ```
 sudo chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh
 ```
